# Auxiliary Data

These two zip archives contain testing data not contained in the
standart Google Speech Commands dataset.

The contents of the _silence_ archive are added to the existing
_silence_ directory together with the generated noise files.

The contents of the _unknown_ archive are merely unpacked into a
directory of the same name.
