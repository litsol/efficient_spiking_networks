	* .pre-commit-config.yaml (repos): Update isort to version
	5.12.0. Running pre-commit was complaining about isort. Upgrading
	to the latest version silenced the errors.

	* pyproject.toml (dependencies): On second thought, move torch and
	numpy from developemnt to package dependencies.

	* pyproject.toml (setup): Remove the --no-editable flag from PDM's
	setup script. If we are setting up our development environment, we
	want to edit our code in situ and see the effects immediately.
