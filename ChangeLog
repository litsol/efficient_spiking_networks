	* .pre-commit-config.yaml (repos): Clean-up data.py, optim.py and
	utils.py and remove them from black's file exclusion list.

	* README.md: Added LD_LIBRARY_PATH requirement.

	* .pylintrc (overgeneral-exceptions): Specifying exception names
	in the overgeneral-exceptions option without module name is
	deprecated. This is just a warning for future pylint releases.  I
	obviated the error message by updating the exception specification
	in the module's .pylintrc configuration file.

	* pyproject.toml (tool.black): Enumerating an explicit list of filed to exclude did not work.
	exclude = '''
	/(
	   src/GSC/data.py
	 | src/GSC/optim.py
	 | src/srnn_fin.py
	 | utils.py
	)/
	'''
	force-exclude = 'src/GSC/*' worked on a directory basis, but I want finer grained controll.

	I moved the exclusion list from pyproject.toml to .pre-commit-config.yaml.

	* .pre-commit-config.yaml (black):

	Back's exclusion list won't exclude individual files. The solution
	seems to be to exclude some files on running black using pre-commit:

	Since I want to enumerate several files, I rely on pre-commit regular expression syntax:

	* pyproject.toml (dependencies):
	Added "librosa>=0.9.2", "matplotlib>=3.7.0", "torchvision>=0.14.1"
	dependencies to get srnn_fin.py running.

2023-02-08  Michael Guravage  <michael@odysseus>

	* .pre-commit-config.yaml (repos): Update isort to version
	5.12.0. Running pre-commit was complaining about isort. Upgrading
	to the latest version silenced the errors.

2022-11-16  Michael Guravage  <michael@odysseus>

	* pyproject.toml (dependencies): On second thought, move torch and
	numpy from developemnt to package dependencies.

2022-11-11  Michael  <michael@ajax>

	* pdm.lock (name): Added bumpver.

	* README.md (Version): Added bumpver version pattern.

	* pyproject.toml (push): Added bumpver configuration and file
	patterns.

2022-11-10  Michael  <michael@literatesolutions.comx>

	* pyproject.toml (setup): Remove the --no-editable flag from PDM's
	setup script. If we are setting up our development environment, we
	want to edit our code in situ and see the effects immediately.
